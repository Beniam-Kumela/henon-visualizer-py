# Hénon Map Animator (Python)

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Hénon map animator. It uses the following equations to generate data for the logistic graph:

<img src = "https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?&space;x_{n&plus;1}=1-ax_{n}^{2}&plus;y_{n}">

<img src = "https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y_{n&plus;1}=bx_{n}">

There is also a Hénon logistic map generator for those that are interested.

## Features

- Prompts user with animation settings and information.
- Animation provides live updates with where function is at in terms of constants
- Real-time progress bar lets the user know how many frames have been compiled during rendering.
- Upon completing the animation, it lets the user know that it is saved to the directory in which the .exe file is located.

## Dependencies

Make sure that you have Python installed as this project depends on the following libraries:

- matplotlib
- tqdm

If these are not already installed refer to step 4 and 5 in "Building and Running".

## Building and Running

### Windows

1. Download the .zip file by pressing the green "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP".
2. Go to folder the file was downloaded to an extract all components to a directory.
3. While in file explorer click on the bar with your directory, type cmd, and press Enter.
4. If some of the dependencies are not already installed, put in the following lines in your command prompt:
```
pip install matplotlib
pip install tqdm
```
6. Run the following line in command prompt:
```
python -m animate.py
```
7. Once completed with the application, the generated animation will be saved to this directory.

### Customization

If any edits want to be made to the code navigate to the animate.py file to make changes and run in a virtual environment.

## Example

Animation generated by animate.py in blue with 1000 iterations for each data point and 140 frames:
